The Zen of Ruby
Implicit Return
2 min
We know that methods in Ruby can return values, and we ask a method to return a value when we want to use it in another part of our program. What if we don’t put a return statement in our method definition, though?

For instance, if you don’t tell a JavaScript function exactly what to return, it’ll return undefined. For Python, the default return value is None. But for Ruby, it’s something different: Ruby’s methods will return the result of the last evaluated expression.
